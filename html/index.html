							<h3>Automagic</h3>
						<p class="">
							&emsp;This is a full-stack application built on the MEAN stack. In short, it automates several repetitive tasks at my current job. It offers an interface where employees can gather data from the internet, compare that with information in a database (which is compiled and maintained by the application and by the users), and then presents the results back to the user in a directly useable format.
							<br><br>
							&emsp;At first, I began writing the code for this project just to see if it was possible, but as the project grew, I knew I had to share it. I built a prototype to show to my supervisors, and they told me to go ahead with the project. After completing a full version, I was able to coordinate a beta test with a handful of other employees. With positive feedback from the testers, I had the application approved for company-wide use by the management. Now, I am happy to say the app is used as a part of everyday workflow within the company. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/gtrabbit/newautomagic" target="_blank">Github repo for Automagic</a> to see the source code.
							<br><br>
							Here is what some of my co-workers have said about it:
							</p>
							</div>
							<div class="holder smaller fader">
								<blockquote>
								“From the very first PL I drafted, I have been imagining a tool like Automagic. The amount of time spent gathering journal and article rankings is frustrating and has quite often turned a good day bad or a bad day worse… I am practically gleeful every time I use Automagic! I think it's a great interface, so intuitive and easy to use, and I feel like the luckiest person in the A2 office for being able to use it already.”

							<div class="holder smaller fader">
								<blockquote >
								“Working with the so-called "automagic" application has been a great experience so far... In the past, identifying a client's papers published in highly ranked journals could be a time consuming addition to writing letters, but "automagic" has made the process so much more efficient. This impact is only made clearer when using it for petition letters, as "automagic" quickly and accurately returns journal and citation information in under ten minutes... ”

				<h2 class="fader"> The full story... </h2>
				<div class="holder">
				<h3>Business Logic</h3>
				<p>
					I will try not to bore you too much with the details, but I currently work as a legal writer for an immigration law firm that helps scientists gain permanent visas to the United States. One thing we have to do is get information about every journal where they have published articles, how often they have been cited, etc. We would put this together for each application, but the information was never organized or stored anywhere, so each time we would start fresh. I found myself looking up the same information over and over again, and it frustrated me to think that someone across the room might be looking up the same journals and we had no way of sharing our work. Everyone knew the system was tiresome and inefficient, but no one had a solution. 
				</p>
				<h3>Crawlers</h3>
				<p>
				
					After learning a little programming, I realized I could use those skills to make a better system. I began by writing a web crawler that used regular expressions to pull all the relevant information from a client's Google Scholar profile. Next, I built a second web crawler that pulled the top 10 journals from each Google Scholar category (sorry, Google) and stored that information in a Mongo database. Then, I wrote a script to parse a spreadsheet from Thomson Reuters showing the "Impact Factor" of every journal, and combined that with the Google Scholar rankings in the database. I also wrote code to determine if each article qualified as "highly cited" according to charts released by Thomson Reuters that rank by field of study, year of publication, and number of citations.
				</p>
					<div class="img-wrapper block auto2"></div>
			
						
				<br>
				<h3>User Interface</h3>
				<p>
					In a perfect world, this all would have been very simple, but I found that there were so many inconsistencies in the data that the majority of the work I put into the app was focused on creating the interface that allows users to gather, edit and modify the data as needed. For instance, clients often list journals by abbreviation (or just plain spell them wrong), and Google Scholar and Thomson Reuters may differ in how they name the same journal. Users therefore need to be able to monitor for such inconsistencies and make changes as needed. At the same time, the whole purpose of the application is to save time, so I had to make the process as seamless as possible. While I know the user interface is not very flashy, it is intuitive, efficient and very effective at what it does. I think building an intuitive user interface was my favorite part of the project and I would love to do more work like this in the future.
				</p>
				<h3>Node voodoo magic</h3>
				<p>
					Another challenge I had to overcome is that we have to provide "evidence" of all information submitted to the immigration office. Thus,  After obtaining the list of journal rankings, the user clicks a button to download a zip file of PDFs of each webpage where I pulled information. A lot of the heavy lifting is done by npm packages. I use a crawler (tinyreq) to grab the html source of each page; this is then fed to a phantom.js wrapper (html-to-pdf) that (you guessed it) converts the html to a pdf. These are then complied into a zip using jszip, and served to the user out of a temporary folder.
				</p>
				<div class="img-wrapper medium auto3 float-left"></div>
				<h3>Maintenance</h3>
				<p>
					Finally, I had to build a "back-end" for the application where users could update and maintain the database, as journal rankings and citation percentiles are constantly being updated. This way, the application can remain in use <em>in perpetuum</em> even after I leave the company. 
				</p>

				<h3>Benefits for the company</h3>
					<p>
					Using my app to gather this information takes between 5-10 minutes from start to finish. Before, it took half an hour minimum, and up to an hour or more for especially prolific clients. The company is still growing, but already with more than 50 employees using the app, I am probably saving the company close to 40 hours a week. It's like I've given them a full-time employee who works for free. I can't help but think that this is really awesome. 
				</p>
				</div>

				<div class="holder">
				<h3>And for me</h3>
					<p>
					Personally, even though the application might not mean much to someone outside of the company, I am very proud of the work I put into it. I identified a problem, came up with a solution, wrote all the code, pitched the app to the company, oversaw testing-- everything. When I started, I knew almost nothing about back-end programing, and asynchronous code was a total mystery to me. I was learning everything for the first time, doing whatever needed to be done. Moreover, I was doing it all on my own initiative, on my own time, with no assurance that it would ever be used by anyone else. So, working on this project certainly helped me grow as a <em>coder</em>, but more importantly, it helped me grow as a <em>developer</em>-- as someone who can work through difficulties to deliver solutions for real-life problems. I am thrilled to have built something that people are using every day: something that improves productivity and saves employees from mindless toil. I can't wait to see what I can do while working as part of a team.

						The above is a side-project I have been working on when I want a "break" from my other coding projects. It is in perpetual development, and while technically playable, I make no promises about it being fun.
					</p>
					<p class="fader">
						The game makes use of the <a href="http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/" target="_blank">ROT.js library</a> by Ondrej Zara, and was originally written following a tutorial, but I've expanded <strong>massively</strong> from where that left off. So far, I've added frameworks for: character classes, active skills and passive abilities, stats, random item generation, magic, and the list keeps growing.
					</p>
					<p class="fader">
						I am collaborating on this project with an old friend who doesn't really know how to code, but loves rogue-likes and has tons of great ideas. So, I build the functions and put everything together, and he does content development. Building abstractions that a non-coder can understand and work with has been a really compelling challenge that has forced me to write better code.

				<h2>About Me</h2>

					<p>
						I came into web development via an unusual route. I earned a BA in English in 2007, then graduated with a MFA in poetry from the University of Pittsburgh in 2009. A while later, I moved to South Korea, where I taught ESL for two years. I returned to the US in 2013, bought a house in Pittsburgh, got married, did some traveling, and spent a lot of time meditating. I began working as a professional writer for an immigration law firm in 2015, and began my journey as a developer the following year. <br><br>

						Although I had enjoyed teaching, it did not satisfy the creative impulse that had driven me to pursue a degree in English. While my job paid well enough, I was doing the same thing every week and wasn't learning or growing. When I heard a co-worker mention he was learning some computer programming, I decided to try it out myself. I was an easy convert, and it wasn't long until my nights and weekends were totally booked with projects and coursework from an assortment of online resources. As I developed more competence, I realized that coding could be the creative outlet I had been craving. Earlier this year, I finished what felt like <a href="#automagic">my first "real" project</a>, which is now being used to boost productivity at the company where I work. Seeing people using the application I built is such a thrill, and I look forward to see where this career will take me next.
